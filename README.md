# Dobble
Game using Python, OOP, Jupyter Notebook

Each card in Dobble features eight different symbols. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. Altogether there should be 57 valid cards. For the basic game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. In this way, each card is involved in two tests. At the beginning of the game the players decide how many cards (tests) to play. In the sample games shown below, the players are A and B and a draw can be recorded as a ‘d’ or ‘D.
